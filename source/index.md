# API Version

```
/v0/$collection/$key
```

All request URIs must be prefixed with the current version of the Orchestrate API. The current version is `v0`.

# Request Headers

```shell
# With PUTs a Content-Type header must be set
curl -XPUT "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key" \
	-u "$api_key:" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d "$json"
```

Clients must use request headers accordingly:

* All `GET` requests return JSON and thus must set compatible accept headers, either `application/json` or `*/*`.
* All `PUT` requests must contain a valid JSON body with the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

# Authentication

> Example authenticated GET for a collection/key

```shell
# Pass in your API key as the basic auth username and no password
curl "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key" \
	-u "$api_key:"
```

```java
Client client = new OrchestrateClient("your api key");
```

```go
// Create a new Orchestrate.io client with your API key
c := gorc.NewClient(apiKey)
```

Authentication for Orchestrate.io applications is provided by HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL. Authenticate with an API key as the username and no password. API keys can be created or revoked from the [Orchestrate.io Dashboard](https://dashboard.orchestrate.io) on a per-application basis.

## Ping

If you wish to validate your API key, you can make an authenticated HEAD request to the /v0 endpoint (no collection name necessary). These requests do not count towards your API usage.

> Example API key validation via HEAD request

```shell
# Pass in your API key as the basic auth username and no password
curl --head "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0" \
	-u "$api_key:"
```

```java
client.ping();
```

```go
c.Ping()
```

> If the key is VALID, you will receive a HTTP 200 response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2014 15:17:53 GMT
X-ORCHESTRATE-REQ-ID: 9b2dfb30-cbc3-11e3-a9ec-12313d2f7cdc
Connection: keep-alive
```

> If the key is INVALID, you will receive a HTTP 401 response

```http

```

# Applications

Applications in Orchestrate represent the highest level of your project. Users who are members of an Application are able to view, create, and revoke API keys and use those keys to access the Applicationâ€™s data. Applications are created from the [Orchestrate.io Dashboard](https://dashboard.orchestrate.io).

<aside class="warning">
Application names must be globally unique. It is good practice to prefix application names with your username or organization name.
</aside>

# Collections

Collections are groupings of the JSON objects. Collections are analogous to tables in a relational database.

## Create

You can create collections either from the Orchestrate.io Dashboard or by performing a Key/Value PUT to the collection.

## Delete

> Make sure to replace the collection variable with the appropriate collection name.


```shell
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection?force=true" \
	-XDELETE \
	-u "$api_key:"
```

```java
boolean result =
        client.deleteCollection(collection)
              .get();
```

```go
err := c.DeleteCollection(collection)
```

Deletes an entire collection.

<aside class="notice">
To prevent accidental deletions, `force=true` must be provided in the query string.
</aside>

> Returns response headers like so:

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 24 Oct 2013 15:20:42 GMT
X-ORCHESTRATE-REQ-ID: d88d0ef1-3cbf-11e3-be54-22000ae8057a
Connection: keep-alive
```

`DELETE https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection?force=true`

### Parameters

Parameter  | Description
---------- | -----------
collection | the collection to delete.
force      | must be set to `true` for the delete to succeed.

# Key/Value

Key/Value is core to Orchestrate.io. All other query types are built around this data type. Key/Value pairs are pieces of data identified by a unique key for a collection and have corresponding value.

## Get

> Make sure to replace the collection and key variables with the appropriate collection and key.

```shell
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key" \
	-u "$api_key:"
```

```java
KvObject<DomainObject> object =
        client.kv("someCollection", "someKey")
              .get(DomainObject.class)
              .get();
```

```go
domainObject := new(DomainObject)
result, err := c.Get(collection, key)
err = result.Value(domainObject)
```

Get the latest value assigned to a key.

<aside class="notice">
Previous versions can be retrieved by performing a GET on the fully qualified value of a GET's `Content-Location` header or a PUT's `Location` header.
</aside>

### HTTP Request

> Returns response headers like so:

```http

```

`GET https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key`

### Parameters

Parameter  | Description
---------- | -----------
collection | the collection from which to get the value.
key        | the key for a value to be retrieved.

## Put (Create/Update)

> Make sure to replace the variables with the appropriate values.

```shell
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key" \
	-XPUT \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-u "$api_key:" \
	-d "$json"
```

```java
DomainObject obj = new DomainObject(); // a POJO
final KvMetadata kvMetadata =
        client.kv("someCollection", "someKey")
              .put(obj)
              .get();
```

```go
// Put a domain object
path, err := c.Put(collection, key, domainObject)
```

Creates or updates the value at the collection/key specified. The new value will have its own unique version and that value will always be retrievable at its fully qualified 'ref' location.  That location is made available in the 'Location' response header.

<aside class="warning">
All values must be valid JSON.
</aside>

### HTTP Request

> Returns response headers like so:

`PUT https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key`

### Conditional PUTs

```shell
# An If-Match PUT
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key" \
	-XPUT \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "If-Match: \"cbb48f9464612f20\"" \
	-u "$api_key:" \
	-d "$json"

# An If-None-Match PUT
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key" \
	-XPUT \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "If-None-Match: \"*\" \
	-u "$api_key:" \
	-d "$json"
```

```java
// An If-Match PUT
DomainObject obj = new DomainObject(); // a POJO
KvMetadata kvMetadata =
        client.kv("someCollection", "someKey")
              .ifMatch("someRef")
              .put(obj)
              .get();

// An If-None-Match PUT
DomainObject obj = new DomainObject(); // a POJO
KvMetadata kvMetadata =
        client.kv("someCollection", "someKey")
              .ifAbsent()
              .put(obj)
              .get();
```

```go
// If-Match PUT. Takes the path of the last seen version.
path, err := c.PutIfUnmodified(path, domainObject)

// If-None-Match PUT.
path, err := c.PutIfAbsent(collection, key, domainObject)
```

Conditional headers can be used to specify a pre-condition that determines whether the store operation happens. The `If-Match` header specifies that the store operation will succeed if and only if the _ref_ value matches current stored ref. The `If-None-Match` header specifies that the store operation will succeed if and only if the key doesn't already exist.

<aside class="notice">
Conditional headers must provide a double-quoted `ETag` value returned by either a GET or PUT.
</aside>

Header        | Description
------------- | -----------
<nobr>If-Match</nobr> | Stores the value for the key if the value for this header matches the current `ref` value.
<nobr>If-None-Match</nobr> | Stores the value for the key if no key/value already exists, the only valid value for this header is `"*"`.

*If-Match* and *If-None-Match* headers cannot be supplied together.

### Parameters

Parameter  | Description
---------- | -----------
collection | the collection to which to put the value.
key        | the primary key for the value.

## Delete

> Make sure to replace the collection and key variables with the correct collection and key.

```shell
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key" \
	-XDELETE \
	-u "$api_key:"

# permanently delete KV object and all history
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key?purge=true" \
    -XDELETE \
    -u "$api_key:"
```

```java
boolean result =
        client.kv("someCollection", "someKey")
              .delete()
              .get();
```

```go
err := c.Delete(collection, key)
```

Deletes set the value of a key to a null object. Previous versions of an object are retrievable at its fully qualified 'ref' location. If the `purge` parameter is supplied the object and its `ref` history will be permanently deleted.

### HTTP Request

              .get();
```

```go
// If-Match Delete
err := c.DeleteIfUnmodified(path)
```

Conditional headers can be used to specify a pre-condition that determines whether the delete operation happens. The `If-Match` header specifies that the delete operation will succeed if and only if the _ref_ value matches current stored ref.

<aside class="notice">
Conditional headers must provide a double-quoted `ETag` value returned by either a GET or PUT.
</aside>

Header        | Description
------------- | -----------
<nobr>If-Match</nobr> | Deletes the value for the key if the value for this header matches the current `ref` value.

### Parameters

Parameter  | Description
---------- | -----------
collection | the collection to delete from.
key        | the key to delete.
purge      | If `true` the KV object and all of its `ref` history will be permanently deleted. This operation cannot be undone.

## List

> Make sure to replace all the variables with the appropriate values.

```shell
# Inclusive start key
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection?startKey=$startKey&limit=$limit" \
	-u "$api_key:"

# Exclusive after key
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection?afterKey=$afterKey&limit=$limit" \
	-u "$api_key:"

# Inclusive start key up to an exclusive end key
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection?startKey=$startKey&beforeKey=$beforeKey&limit=$limit" \
    -u "$api_key:"
```

```java
KvList<DomainObject> kvList =

              .limit(20)
              .get(DomainObject.class)
              .get();
```

```go
// List from beginning
results, err := c.List(collection, limit)

// List after key
results, err := c.ListAfter(collection, afterKey, limit)

//List starting with key
results, err := c.ListStart(collection, startKey, limit)

// Get next page
if results.HasNext() {
	nextResults, err := c.ListGetNext(results)
}
```

Returns a paginated, lexicographically ordered list of items contained in a
collection. The next page of results URL is specified by both the `next` field
in the JSON response and the `Link` header value. If no `next` field or `Link`
header is returned, there are no additional pages.

---------- | -----------
collection | the collection from which to get the value.
key        | the primary key of the value.
ref        | an opaque version identifier for the value.

# Search

Search allows collections to be queried using [Lucene Query Parser Syntax](http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_3_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#Overview).

## Collection

> Make sure to replace all the variables with the appropriate values.

```shell
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection?query=$query&limit=$limit&offset=$offset" \
	-u "$api_key:"
```

```java
String luceneQuery = "*";
SearchResults<DomainObject> results =
        client.searchCollection("someCollection")
              .limit(20)
              .get(DomainObject.class, luceneQuery)
              .get();
```

```go
results, err := c.Search(collection, query, offset, limit)

// Get next page
if results.HasNext() {
	nextResults, err := c.SearchGetNext(results)
}

// Get previous page
if results.HasPrev() {
	nextResults, err := c.SearchGetPrev(results)
}
```

Returns list of items matching the lucene query. The next page of results URL is specified by both the `next` field in the JSON response and the `Link` header value with a rel=`next`. If no `next` field or `Link` header is returned, there are no additional pages. The same is true for a previous page. If there are preceding results, then there will be a URL specified by both the `prev` field in the JSON response and a `Link` header with rel=`prev`.

## Timestamps


There are several event api calls that take a "timestamp" as a parameter (either as a url path parm or a query param).

Wherever a timestamp is expected in the events api calls, the value can be in any of the following formats:

- A Long that is the milliseconds since epoch
  - 784111777000
  - 784111777221
- ISO8601 Basic with or without the milliseconds portion
  - 19941106T084937Z
  - 19941106T084937.221Z
  - 19941106T014937-0700
  - 19941106T014937.221-0700
- ISO8601 Extended with or without the milliseconds portion
  - 1994-11-06T08:49:37Z
  - 1994-11-06T08:49:37.221Z
  - 1994-11-06T01:49:37-07:00
  - 1994-11-06T01:49:37.221-07:00
- RFC2616 Compatible Dates. This allows the following formats:
  - RFC1123
     - Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 UTC
     - Sun, 06 Nov 1994 01:49:37 MST
     - Sun, 06 Nov 1994 01:49:37 -0700
  - RFC1036 (2-digit date supported and uses 2000 as start year)
     - Sunday, 06-Nov-1994 08:49:37 UTC
     - Sunday, 06-Nov-1994 01:49:37 MST
     - Sunday, 06-Nov-1994 01:49:37 -0700
  - ASCTIME (UTC Enforced)
     - Sun Nov 6 08:49:37 1994

<aside class="notice">
While the api will accept all these formats as input parameters, the event timestamp is always returned by the api as milliseconds since epoch.

# Graph

The Graph functionality allows for directed relations to be created between collection/key pairs and for those relations to be traversed.

## Get

> Make sure to replace all the variables with the appropriate values.

```shell
# One hop
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key/relations/$kind" \
	-u "$api_key:"

# Two hops
curl -i "https://api.orchestrate.io/v0/$collection/$key/relations/$kind1/$kind2" \
	-u "$api_key:"
```

```java
// One hop
Iterable<KvObject<DomainObject>> results =
        client.relation("someCollection", "someKey")
              .get(DomainObject.class, "someKind")
              .get();

// Two hops
Iterable<KvObject<DomainObject>> results =
        client.relation("someCollection", "someKey")
              .get(DomainObject.class, "someKind", "someKind")
              .get();
```

```go
// One hop
results, err := c.GetRelations(collection, key, []string{kind})

// Two hops
results, err := c.GetRelations(collection, key, []string{kind1, kind2})
```

Returns relation's collection, key, ref, and values. The "kind" parameter(s) indicate which relations to walk and the depth to walk.

e.g. Get users that are friends of John's family members.
